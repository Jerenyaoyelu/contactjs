## Run locally

### Install

- `pnpm i`

### Run Homepage

- `pnpm hp dev`

### Create an app

- `with vite`

`pnpm create vite apps/<folder-name>`

- `with next`

  `pnpm create next-app apps/<folder-name>`

  > Issue: The next version in the package.json generated by this command is 13.2.3, which leads to a running problem.

  > So, it's better creating next app router project with yarn or npx

  `yarn create next-app apps/<folder-name>`
